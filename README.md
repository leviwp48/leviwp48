🔭 I’m currently working on an app to help me choose what to cook for the day!

I'm Levi, a software engineer from California, US.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development or backend development and I am currently in search of my next role. 

I'm fascinated by products, big or small, that have a high positive impact on other's lives. I've worked on industry-leading services as well as apps that have high user traffic. I have contributed to major feature launches, observability and pipelines for infrastructure, and high trafficked API's that were customer-facing.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science - robotics,  I also play a lot of video games and make tech-related TikToks (470,000 followers and counting).

Let's connect!
